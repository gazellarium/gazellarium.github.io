The goal was to test if Persian speakers exhibit any sensitivity to the SSP taking into account their linguistic experience with Persian phonotactic constraints with a CVC(C) syllable structure. Persian syllables have no attested onset clusters, and 21% of the attested coda clusters are against the SSP. The results confirmed the view that speakers can generalize their phonotactic knowledge beyond their lexicon and the fact that they exhibit some innate biases despite their lack of experience, along the lines of the POS argument.\n🔗 The original work is an unpublished thesis in Persian, but an English excerpt of it and the stimuli set and r scripts are accessible on an osf repository.\n🔗 The interactive individual participant plots can be viewed on this shinyapp page.",
